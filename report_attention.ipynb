    "In May of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states had the right to legalize sports betting, overturning a longstanding law. Since then, dozens of states have introduced legislation to allow betting sites to operate within their borders, and the cumulative value of the American sports betting market is expected to reach \\$8 billion by 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anecdotally, betting lines are remarkably accurate at predicting outcomes, but as an aggregation of human opinions, they are inherently biased. We believe that we can improve on these group-think predictions by taking a data-driven approach towards odds making. Traditional NBA forecast models use team-based statistics to predict the outcome of games. Here, we've designed a deep learning system that utilizes individualized player data in addition to conventional game statistics to generate more accurate forecasts of team point production in a given match-up."
