# Data Files
Our original, unprocessed data is stored in the `raw` directory. Those files
include the Excel downloads from Sports Book Review Online, team schedules
scraped from Basketball Reference, and boxscores for each of those games also
scraped from Basketball Reference. The `raptor.csv` file is pulled directly from
FiveThirtyEight's GitHub, and stores all the relevant RAPTOR statistics.

## Train / Test
The raw data required a lot of cleaning and processing before it became usable.
All the files within the `train` and `test` directory are prefixed by their
year, which makes retrieving data easier. Generally, we've used Basketball
Reference's IDs to identify players and games. Games are identified by their
unique URL, and players are identified by a unique string generated by
Basketball Reference. This is convenient because RAPTOR uses the same identifier
for the players. Although much of this will be vectorized in our implementation,
the main logic is:
1. For every year in our training set...
2. For every game in that season (From {year}-schedule.csv)
3. Find the players who played in that game from the {year}-box.csv file
4. Load current season statistics from {year}-livestats.csv
5. Load previous season RAPTOR scores from raptor.csv
6. Deep learning magic :) 

Our training years are the 2015 - 2018 seasons, and the 2019 season is our test
year. This is an 80% / 20% split, which although weighs the training slightly
heavier, is in line with the general wisdom.
